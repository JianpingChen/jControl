JavaScript Source code in this project requires "RequireJs" to work. A copy of require.js is included in the project 
for your convenience. Please honour the license set forth by RequireJS (http://requirejs.org/).

All accompanying CSS files are generated by SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) which requires 
Ruby (http://www.rubyinstaller.org/) to run.

To minimize JavaScript code, you may need nodeJs (http://nodejs.org/).

A MicroSoft ASP.NET MVC project is provided in the source as an example for using this library. 
To run the sample project, you'd need MicroSoft Visual Studio v10. 

A set of JavaScript unit tests is also included for quality assurance. 

TestCore.html runs a set of QUnit tests for classes in "elements" and "observe" folder. If you modified any classes 
in these two folders, please add unit tests for your modification in the corresponding test files. If you need to 
add additional classes to these folders, please add unit test files for them and include your tests in coreTests.js 
which is executed in TestCore.html.

TestJControl.html runs a set of QUnit tests for classes in "controls" folder. If you modified any classes in "controls" 
folder, please add unit tests for your modification in the corresponding test files. If you need to add additional 
classes to "controls" folder, please add unit test files for them and include your tests in controlTests.js 
which is executed in TestJControl.html.

Any new classes contributed to this project are expected to follow the same coding style. Comments in code should be 
limited to documentation (YUI Doc style, http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/syntax/) and licensing information. Any extra
