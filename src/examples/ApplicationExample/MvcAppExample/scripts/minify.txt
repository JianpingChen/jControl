You need "node" and "r.js" to minify your build.

For more details on minimizing your javascripts using requirejs, please visit: http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html

To minify your scripts into "build.1.0.0.0.js", run the following command in the "scripts" folder.

node r.js -o name=mvcApp out=build.1.0.0.0.js baseUrl=. optimize=none

If you want to embed your version number into file name of the "out" parameter, you'd need some customization.
The benefit of doing this is you won't run into browser script caching issue.

Go to http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
Select "Advanced" for optimization
Paste in the content of build.1.0.0.0.js
Compile
Save default.js to ugly.js

Done!
